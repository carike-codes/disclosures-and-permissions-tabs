CODE IS NOT FUNCTIONAL YET.  Experimental plugin.  For discussion / development.  Intended as Feature as a Plugin.

== Description ==

VISION STATEMENT:

* We believe that privacy is a strategic competitive advantage.
* This Feature as a Plugin follows a risk-based, as opposed to a compliance-based approach to privacy choices.
* We firmly believe that if your aim is informed consent and you act in good faith at all times, then you are almost certain to come down on the "right" side of legislation.

MISSION STATEMENT:

Thus far many site owners have relied solely on their user experience / visual elements created by a plugin when choosing which of the many plugins fulfilling a particular function to install. We aim to change that.

* DPT seeks to allow website admins / owners to make more informed choices when comparing plugins by facilitating plugin developers' ability to disclose what information is collected from their site and / or their users in a format that makes it understandable for an average user.
* DPT aims to do this by rationally standardizing privacy options within the WordPress ecosystem.
* DPT was developed with the hope of leveraging unrealized synergies.
* DPT does not directly address https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/48486, which only addresses an additional tab to the plugin page on the WordPress.org repository; however, it does seek to compliment it.
* DPT does not seek to replace the Consent API, however, it does seek to compliment it. You can find the Consent API at: https://github.com/rlankhorst/wp-consent-level-api/blob/master/readme.txt
* DPT hopes to assist in implementing sensible guidelines for plugins to advertise premium offerings, to hopefully enable plugin developers to monetize their content without alienating the user-base.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

No.  This code is not yet functional.  It is intended for discussion and development.

= What does this plugin do? =

This plugin is intended as a Feature as a Plugin, which means it will hopefully be included in WordPress core some day soon.
The DPT plugin creates two sub-menus under the Plugins tab in the /wp-admin/ area; namely Disclosures and Permissions.
The Disclosures tab provides those with "manage options" capabilities with privacy related disclosures.
A copy of such disclosures is also available on the plugin's WordPress.org repository page.

Site administrators / owners can turn off permissions for marketing; statistics; and / or anonymous statistics on a site-wide basis; or they can do so on a plugin-by-plugin basis; or they can manage individual permissions (e.g. an external network call to example.com by plugin XYZ) on a plugin-by-plugin basis.
